This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating vector regression techniques applied to a dataset with multiple target variables. The primary focus is on comparing the performance of different regression models: Support Vector Regression (SVR) , Decision Tree Regression , and Random Forest Regression .

The goal of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of various regression models in predicting three target variables (X1, Y1, and Z1) from a dataset obtained by 3D motion capture simulating sit-to-stand motion. It makes use if evaluation metrics such as Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (SROCC), Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Kendall Tau Correlation Coefficient (KCC), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and calculates the median values of each metric across 100 iterations to ensure robustness.
